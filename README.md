# Bus_Ticket_System
The Bus Ticket Booking System is a web-based application that allows users to search for available bus routes, book tickets, and view their bookings. This system is built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a database, meaning all booking records are stored in text files for data persistence.
